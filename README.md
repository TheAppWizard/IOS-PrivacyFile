# iOS Privacy File

This repository contains a demo for implementing Privacy Manifest files in iOS apps.

## Description

iOS apps often require access to sensitive user data or system resources. To ensure user privacy and security, it's essential for developers to provide clear explanations for why their apps need access to such data or resources. The Privacy Manifest file is a crucial component for describing the usage of required reasons API.

For detailed information on Privacy Manifest files and describing the use of the required reason API, refer to [Apple's Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api).
